console.log(total);

// A) you assign some values to some variables
// B) created a for loop that starts at 0 and exits once i goes over the variable limit
// C) inside the for loop, add the value of i to total and at C, that value of i being added to total was run 10 times before the for loop terminated -ie. once the value of i exceeded limit
// D) print out total
